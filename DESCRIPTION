Description: Computation and visualization of matrix correlation coefficients.
    The main method is the Similarity of Matrices Index, while various related
    measures like r1, r2, r3, r4, Yanai's GCD, RV, RV2, adjusted RV, Rozeboom's
    linear correlation and Coxhead's coefficient are included
    for comparison and flexibility.
